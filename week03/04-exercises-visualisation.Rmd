## 1. Unemployment in the US

Try to replicate the following line chart that displays the evolution in the unemployment rate in the US over time. The challenge here consists of overlaying a set of shaded boxes in red or blue, depending on the party to which the president in power at the time belongs. To help with that part, you can see below how to create a data frame with the relevant information.

```{r}
# Creating a dataframe with the unemployment data
unemp <- read_csv("data/unemployment.csv")

# Creating a data frame with the background colour information
name <- c("Truman", "Eisenhower", "Kennedy", "Johnson", "Nixon",
        "Ford", "Carter", "Reagan", "Bush I", "Clinton", "Bush II",
        "Obama")
start <- as.Date(c("1948-01-01", "1953-01-20", "1961-01-20", "1963-11-22",
        "1969-01-20", "1974-08-09", "1977-01-20", "1981-01-20",
        "1989-01-20", "1993-01-20", "2001-01-20", "2009-01-20"))
end <- c(start[-1], as.Date("2016-10-01"))
party <- c("D", "R", "D", "D", "R", "R", "D", "R", "R", "D", "R", "D")
pres <- data.frame(name, start, end, party, stringsAsFactors=F)
```
install.packages("ggplot2")   # If not already installed
install.packages("readr") 

![](04-unemployment.png)

```{r}

# Define range of unemployment and date variables
range(unemp$unemp, na.rm = TRUE)
range(unemp$date, na.rm = TRUE)

# Creating a line-plot with unemployment and date
ggplot(data = unemp, aes(x = date, y = unemp)) + 
  geom_line(color = "black") +  
  labs(title = "",  
       x = "",
       y = "Unemployment Rate") +
  theme_minimal() +
  
# Adding the rectangle geometry (set axes limits so that background covers entire plot)
geom_rect(data = pres, aes(xmin = start, xmax = end, ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf, fill = party), alpha = 0.2) +
    


  # Add vertical dotted lines at the start of each presidential term
  geom_vline(data = pres, aes(xintercept = start), linetype = "dotted", color = "gray") +

  # Add president names at the start of each term
  geom_text(data = pres, aes(x = start, y = max(unemp$unemp) * 0.95, label = name),
           size = 2, vjust = -0.5, color = "black", angle = 90) +

# Adding lines to separate presidencies
geom_rect(data = pres, aes(xmin = start, xmax = end, ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf, fill = party, alpha = 0.2) ) +
 scale_fill_manual(values = c("D" = "blue", "R" = "red"), guide = FALSE) 

# Finally, moving legend and removing x axis title



# Adjusting y axis



```


## 2. Interactive plots with Plotly

A great package for interactive plots is `Plotly`. For the general documentation of the R package and a wide range of sample plots, see this [link](https://plotly.com/r/).

In the following, the task is to create a 3D plot using the sample of public Facebook posts:

- Restrict the sample to only posts with >= 5000 likes 
- x-axis: Log of likes count
- y-axis: Log of shares count
- z-axis: Length of the message (create a new column with the `str_count` function)
- Colour coding of points: Party

Judging approximately from the figure, which party writes the longest posts in this sub sample? Which party has most likes and shares?

Reading in the data and some initial processing:

```{r}
df <- read_csv("data/fb-congress-data.csv")

# Dropping some very uncommon post types
nrow(df)
df <- df %>%
  filter(!post_type %in% c("music", "note"))
nrow(df)
```

Creating the plot data:

```{r}
df_plot <- df[df$likes_count > 5000,]
df_plot$message_length <- _________(df_plot$message)
df_plot <- df_plot %>% select(likes_count, shares_count, message_length, party)
df_plot <- drop_na(df_plot)
df_plot$party <- as.factor(df_plot$party)
```

Plot:

```{r}
plotlyfigure1 <- plot_ly(df_plot, type= "scatter3d", mode = "markers", x = _________,
               y = _________, z = _________, color = ~party)
plotlyfigure1 <- plotlyfigure1 %>% layout(scene = list(xaxis = list(title = "Log likes count", type = "log"),
                     yaxis = list(title = "Log shares count", type = "log"),
                     zaxis = list(title = "Message length")))
plotlyfigure1
```


Plotly can also create many plots similar to the ones that we have discussed with `ggplot2` before, e.g. violin plots:

```{r}
plotlyfigure2 <- plot_ly(df_plot[df_plot$message_length>500 &
                                df_plot$party %in% c("Democrat", "Republican"),],
                      type = _________, y = ~message_length, split = ~party)
plotlyfigure2 <- plotlyfigure2 %>% layout(yaxis = list(title = "Message length"))

plotlyfigure2
```


## 3. Interactive gg-plots

Lastly, using the `ggplotly` function also allows to make a range of ggplot2 plots interactive:

```{r}
p <- ggplot(df[df$likes_count>0 & df$comments_count>0,], 
        aes(x=likes_count, y = comments_count))
p <- p + geom_hex() + scale_x_log10(labels = comma) + scale_y_log10(labels = comma) + 
    scale_fill_continuous()

# Creating an animated plot
ggplotly(p)
```

Note, however, that this will work less well with sophisticated plots that have a lot of features such as the plot you created in Exercise 1.
